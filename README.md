# How to run it
-Clone the repo<br>
-import project in AppFinalProject repo into Eclipse<br>
-import project in guiMain repo into Eclipse<br>
-run the AppfinalProject first to generate simulation and listener<br>
-run the guiMain repo for the visual gui and selections<br>
(after you select a time, you can close the gui by ALT+F4...the simulation data is printed to the system and will show the closest time slot open was selected and booked)
